Civil Ledger

⚖️ Transparent. Immutable. Accountable.
Civil Ledger is an open-source blockchain-based ledger designed to track, verify, and expose the flow of taxpayer funds in real time.

While governments hide behind bureaucracy, mismanagement, and diluted “audits,” Civil Ledger empowers taxpayers to see exactly where their money goes – with mathematical and cryptographic certainty that politicians cannot alter.

🚀 Purpose
“Imagine if every dollar you paid in tax could be traced to its exact end use. No more missing millions. No more budget ‘oversights.’ Only verifiable, immutable public accountability.”

Civil Ledger exists to:

✅ End corruption enabled by opaque accounting.
✅ Provide an open-source, public, real-time ledger for all taxpayers.
✅ Challenge the current system that treats citizens like obedient revenue streams.
✅ Restore trust through technological transparency governments ignore.🛠️ Features
